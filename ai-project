#Traffictelligence is a machine learning-based solution designed to estimate and analyze traffic volume from video or sensor data. 
It leverages advanced AI techniques to provide accurate, real-time insights into traffic patterns, congestion levels, and vehicle counts on roads.


 Key Features:
Real-time Traffic Volume Estimation: Uses deep learning models to detect and count vehicles from live video feeds or traffic camera footage.

Multiple Camera Support: Can aggregate data from multiple camera angles or intersections.

Object Detection Models: Incorporates pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or EfficientDet for vehicle detection.

Region of Interest (ROI) Definition: Custom zones can be defined to monitor specific lanes or traffic directions.

Traffic Flow Metrics: Calculates density, speed estimates, vehicle classification (cars, buses, bikes, etc.).

Dashboard/Visualization: Some versions include dashboards built with tools like Flask, Dash, or Streamlit.



Applications:
Smart city traffic management systems

Highway and toll booth vehicle monitoring

Urban planning and infrastructure optimization

Accident detection and anomaly recognition
